This document describes Nagios::Recover version 0.0.1


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Nagios::Recover qw(recover fixed);

    if (my_service_fails()) {
        my $status = recover(
            service => 'my_service_name',
            action => ["sudo /etc/init.d/my_service restart",
                    "sudo killall -9 my_service_daemon",
                    "sudo /etc/init.d/my_service restart",
                    "sudo /sbin/reboot"
            ]
        );
        print "CRITICAL: $status->{executed}\n";
        exit(2);
    } else {
        fixed( service => 'ftp');
        print "OK.\n";
        exit(0);
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    actions  must be passed. It will try each one in order every time
    you run recover.
    When it reaches the last one it starts again.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 recover

    my $status = recover (
            log => 'syslog', # default syslog, file if passed   [TODO]
          delay => 60,       # wait time between recovery actions,
                             #   default=0 ( no delay )
        service => $service, # service we are checking   [ MANDATORY ]
         action => [ "sudo /etc/init.d/sevice restart" # [ MANDATORY ]
                    ,"sudo killall -9 serviced"
                    ,"sudo /etc/init.d/service restart"
                    ,"sudo init 6"
                    ],
            dir => "/var/run/recover", # Default operational directory
    );

=head2 fixed

    my $status = recover (
        service => $service, # service we are checking   [ MANDATORY ]
            dir => "/var/run/recover", # Default operational directory
    );


=head2 $status

    $status is a hash with the result of the action issued:

    $status->{executed}; # What action was executed.
    $status->{level};    # Action level item. It increases each time
                         # recover is called.
    $status->{out};      # Stdout of action

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS


=over

=item Can't write to dir_lock file

Create the recover dir and make nagios be its owner. Default is /var/run/recover

=item Can't issue recover action

Mostly you haven't configured /etc/sudoers right
