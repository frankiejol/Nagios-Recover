=head1 NAME

Nagios::Recover - Tries to recover a service executing a list of actions


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Nagios::Recover version 0.0.1


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Nagios::Recover qw(recover);

    my $status = recover(
         service => 'ftp',
          action => ["sudo /etc/init.d/ftp restart",
                    "sudo killall -9 ftpd",
                    "sudo /etc/init.d/ftp restart",
                    "sudo init 6"
         ]
    );

    print $status->{executed};
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

    It tries to recover a service in critical condition. A list of 
    actions  must be passed. It will try each one in order every time
    you run recover.
    When it reaches the last one it starts again.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 recover

    my $status = recover (
            log => 'syslog', # default syslog, file if passed   [TODO]
          delay => 60,       # wait time between recovery actions,
                             #   default=0 ( no delay )
        service => $service, # service we are checking   [ MANDATORY ]
         action => [ "sudo /etc/init.d/sevice restart" # [ MANDATORY ]
                    ,"sudo killall -9 serviced"
                    ,"sudo /etc/init.d/service restart"
                    ,"sudo init 6"
                    ],
            dir => "/var/run/recover", # Default operational directory
    );

=head2 $status

    $status is a hash with the result of the action issued:

    $status->{executed}; # What action was executed.
    $status->{level};    # Action level item. It increases each time
                         # recover is called.
    $status->{out};      # Stdout of action
